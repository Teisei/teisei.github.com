##### 156  Binary Tree Upside Down

* 	38.7%		Medium

	
Given a binary tree where all the right nodes are either leaf nodes 
with a sibling (a left node that shares the same parent node) or empty, 
flip it upside down and turn it into a tree where the original right nodes 
turned into left leaf nodes. Return the new root.

	For example:
	Given a binary tree {1,2,3,4,5},
	    1	
	   / \ 
	  2   3
	 / \
	4  5
	
	return the root of the binary tree [4,5,2,#,#,3,1].
	    4
	   / \
	  5   2
	 / \
	3   1

##### 339	Nested List Weight Sum	

* 55.3%		Easy

Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

	Example 1:
	Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], return 10. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1)

	Example 2:
	Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], return 27. (one 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27)
