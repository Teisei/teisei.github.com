## Graph and its representations  

### Graph is a data structure that consists of following two components:  
 * A finite set of vertices  
 * A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u,v) called as edge.

---

### two types of graphs(n nodes) in terms of size
 * **sparse graph**: with `O(n)` nodes;
 * **dense graph** : with `O(n^2)` edges.

---

### Two most commomly used representations of graph  
 * Adjacency Matrix
   + `a(i,j)` is true or false: represent if exist a edge from i to j;
   + `a(i,j)` is a number `x`: represent that the edge from `i` to `j` is weighted of `x`.
 * Adjacency List  
   + for each node `v` is the graph, maintain a list consisting of the `head points` from `v`;
 * Comparison
   + Adjacency can quickly check whether exist a edge(u,v);
   + Adjacency List deals with large sparse graph, and can search the graph quickly.

### Path and Reachable
 A path a set of edges in graph G(V, E); 
 Given two vertex u and v in graph G(V, E), v is reachable from u iff there is a path from u to v.

---

### Search a graph
 * We can imagine that every vertex in graph is a person, and we are trying to find **some person x** in the graph.
 * So we pass a message("to find person x") to one person and check if he is exactly the one we want;
 * If he is, we end this search; else he pass the message to person he heads to and try to ;
 * Here is just a matter of how the message is passes across the graph;
 * Every time we pass the message to another person, we want the guy to tell us if he can find person x;
 
#### Find one certain vertex in graph
 We define a message called **find vertex x**; 
 The message is passed across the graph; 
 All vertices once received the message is called **known vertex**.
 
 * **DFS(Depth-First-Search)**
  Every time **person u** just pass the **message** to one **person v** he trust most(just one certain order), 
  and let **person v** helps to do the same thing;
  If v return "got x"; 
  Else, v failed to find x, **person u** pass the message to another person he heads to;
  And we do this steps recursively until we find person x,
  or we can not find x even though we walk through all the graph.
  
 * **BFS(Breadth-First-Search)**
  It like Broadcasting. 
  We start at one person s(source vertex), and broadcast the message to all its **head-points**.
  All the known vertices do the same broadcasting one by one;
  Once one vertex got the message is x(the person we want), the return message to the vertex where x got the message;
  The the "I am x, I am here" message is passed back to the source.
  

#### Visit all the vertices in graph
 * Differences between visiting all and visiting one
 	+ 
 * **DFS**
 	+
 * **BFS**
