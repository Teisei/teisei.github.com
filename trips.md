I &hearts; traveling. I think having the ability to travel around the world is
one of the most amazing things in the world! I have been to different places
(as shown on the map below), and each trip has been a rich experience where I
have had the opportunity to meet awesome people, eat tasty food, but also visit
amazing spots.
